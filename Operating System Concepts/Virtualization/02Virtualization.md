# What is virtualization?

Virtualization is the creation of a virtual --rather than actual-- version of something, such as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network resources.

Virtualization uses software that simulates hardware functionality to create a virtual system. 

This practice allows IT organizations to operate multiple operating systems, more than one virtual system and various applications on a single server. The benefits of virtualization include greater efficiencies and economies of scale.

OS virtualization is the use of software to allow a piece of hardware to run multiple operating system images at the same time.  The technology got its start on mainframes decades ago, allowing administrators to avoid wasting expensive processing power.
